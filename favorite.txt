My Favorite Things

--

cat, more, less, most
and don't forget tac

grep, egrep, ag and
of course there is ack

find piped to xargs
is like backticks with wings

these are a few of my favorite things

--

head is like tail
nl is like seq

yes is jot -by 0
sort -u's like uniq

The -c arg or head -2
both will limit the pings

these are a few of my favorite things

--

when the disk's full
when the RAM's gone
when processes abort

I remember dmesg, df and du
which goes well with sort

--

bc, dc, expr
printf is there too

locate and find
both find files for you

wc counts words
extract them with strings

these are a few of my favorite things

--

diff versus patch
cut versus paste

comm and yes join
make dbs seem a waste

wget, curl, nc
show what the web brings

these are a few of my favorite things

--

when the internet breaks
when the upgrades fail
when a high level language toolchain makes you sad

I Read The Fine Man pages
with apropos or man -k

And then I don't feel
so bad
